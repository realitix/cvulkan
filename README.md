## How to contribute

To contribute, you should first read the `How it works` section.
Any contribution is welcome and I answer quickly.

##Â How it works

CVulkan is a C module generated by a Python script. To proceed, the script `vulkan_generator.py`
computes a model of Vulkan API based on `vk.xml` (the file from Kronos describing the API) and then
uses `jinja2` templates to write the `vulkanmodule.c` file.

Here the basic steps:

 - Load vk.xml
 - Use `xmltodict` to parse the xml document
 - Generate a good data model from it
 - Pass the model to the `jinja2` template engine
 - The template engine generate the final c file
